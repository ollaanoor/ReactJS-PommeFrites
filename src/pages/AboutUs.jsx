        At Pomme Frites, we are passionate about bringing you the finest and
        most delicious fries from around the world. Our journey began with a
        simple love for crispy, golden fries, and has grown into a mission to
        share that love with everyone.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold my-5">Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Founded in 2025, Pomme Frites started as a small food truck in
        Alexandria, Egypt. Our founder, Olla, had a vision to create a place
        where people could enjoy high-quality fries with a variety of unique and
        flavorful toppings. What began as a humble food truck quickly gained
        popularity, and soon, Pomme Frites became a beloved local favorite.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold my-5">Our Mission</h2>
      <p>

        tasted. We believe in using only the freshest ingredients and preparing
        everything with care and attention to detail. Whether you're a fan of
